We are an organization of motivated and talented individuals who work together toward various common goals. What are those goals? It depends. We have many products and future projects. Most of our software is free and we also shared a great deal of our technology via open source. Most people involved in Grinec WSDS are doing many things for free, out of their own spare time. Some people collaborate often while some take a more passive role, but still ready to help when they\'re needed. Regardless of who they are and what they do... Grinec WSDS has, is and always will have one single most important target: to change the world for the better! How can a group of people working mostly from their free time do this? Simple: talent, passion, will and good ideas. We got all of these and even more. Also, we hope that our selfless dedication in the pursuit of quality and knowledge will show through our actions and that richer people who think the same way we do will help us here and there. While we will mostly be relying on donations and small incomes from advertising here and there (we are against annoying advertising), we also have a few paid products.';

<h4>Introduction - why use an online diff?</h4>
	
<div>
<p>In my course as a developer I find myself constantly examining the differences between two pieces of text.
</p>
<p>Now, although pretty much every IDE (and various stand-alone products) have sophisticated diff utilities built in (like <a href="http://www.eclipse.org" target="eclipse">Eclipse</a>), my favourite,
I got very tired of having to create two files just to paste in fragments of code or other bits of texts just in order to perform a diff and see the differences highlighted. </p>
<p>
This is why I made myself a quick online version that I have now decided to share with anyone else interested. (Update - Since the previous version of this tool stopped working,  this current version was created by Harmen Stoppels.)<br>
</p>
<h2><a class="hideshow">Click here for instructions</a></h2>
<div id="how_to_use">
<p>Simply paste your first text into the left text box and the other text into the right box and hit "Submit" to see the results.
</p>
<p>
I have added the following options :
<dl>
  <dt>Trim Lines</dt>
  <dd>Trims empty spaces on the beginning and end of each line on both inputs prior to comparing</dd>
  <dt>Remove Empty Lines</dt>
  <dd>Removes empty lines on both inputs prior to comparing</dd>
  <dt>Remove excess Whitespace</dt>
  <dd>Removes any instances of two or more subsequent whitespaces and replaces it with a single one</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<p>
I have also added the following options for diff algorithms:
<dl>
  <dt>Side-by-side</dt>
  <dd>Shows the differences side by side</dd>
  <dt>Inline</dt>
  <dd>Shows the differences inline, using the  <a href="http://www.pear.php.net/package/Text_Diff">Pear Diff Class</a></dd>
 
</dl>
</p>
<p>
For long comparisons to avoid scrolling all the way up to do a follow-up comparison, I have also included a copy of the form on the bottom of the page after a submit has taken place.
